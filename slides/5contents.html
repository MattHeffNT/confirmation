      So first I'mma hit you with the executive version of
      what my PhD is... that way you won't miss anything if you do
      switch off later on my yarn....I've been told I have a relaxing voice...
      I'll actually be doing a podcast with ABC kids soon which is about relaxing stories to help kids and parents fall
      asleep
      THATS HOW CHILL MY VOICE IS....anyway
    </li>
    <li>
      Then I want to go through the thematic groupings of my lit review.... go through some of the things that I've
      found interesting
      and how that will inform the next phase of my work.
    </li>
    <li>
      Then of course there's the methodology, I'll go through that.
      but then chat about how i want to sort of tweak it - make it more Heff/blackfulla.
    </li>
    <li>
      Of course there is the contribution to the field... I want to talk a little bit about the outputs
      from the research, but then also some of the things that will be created within the research itself
      that I hope will contribute to this wonderful thing we're calling Cybernetics.
    </li>
    <li>
      I used to love asking this question in policy work days...
      "then what?". So I'll talk a little bit about the immediate few things happening
      as part of the PHD.

    </li>
    <li>
      To conclude, I'll give you another TL;DR but even faster..so just in case you didn't
      listen first time round, you definitely will. I don't know.

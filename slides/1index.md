#### Matthew Ngamurarri Heffernan 

note:

- Good afternoon everyone thanks for joining me, my name is Matt Ngamurarri Heffernan.

- I know you're all mad at me because the title of my PhD doesn't have paragraphs of a subtitle. But it will probably change, so please relax. It can change right?

 - I want to take this opportunity to welcome and thank my supervisors who have joined us today. 

VC Distinguished Professor Genevieve Bell, Professor Katherine Daniell, Professor Brian David Johnson and Professor Angie Abdilla

- I also want to thank my PhD Cohort for all the yarns

- And thank my Master's cohort who are some of my best friends and have been a source of sanity for me

- And of course, thank all the staff and supporters of Cybernetics over the years who have made my life so interesting. Well at least to me

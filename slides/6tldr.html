    <li>I'm interested in what happens when you kind of mush together
      a few concepts and ideas.
    </li>
    <li> I want to write about the ideas, technology, solutions or questions that
      emerge from said mushing. Or I should say synthesis.
    </li>
    <li>
      I frame it like this... at the 1939 New York Wolrds Fair a fella
      called Norman Bel Geddes (dunno how to say his name) presented his vision of the future
      he called it Futurama (yes what the show is named after).

    </li>
    <li>

      Futurama was funded by General Motors - it was a minature model
      of a city with highways and the promised freedom of cars.
      Through these imaginings, we now have the dystopia's of car centered cities.

      Deserts of Carparks. And a destructive fossil fuel industry that
      has its claws deep in politics and our psyche on what it means to
      be independent, successful and so on.

    </li>
    <li>

      So what would happen if we built Futures, futuramas, cities
      that weren't "Enshitified". To borrow a term from Cory Doctorow.

      What would happen
      if they were Ochrepunked?

      This review looks at mythology through the lens of media as a system
      for sharing information. It focuses on how 'signal loss', the ways
      information gets distorted or disrupted—affects the way
      mythologies are passed down and changed over time. The review then looks at the
      history of the term Futurism, what were the drivers for it's development.

      followed by how African diaspora and particularly African Americans have created
      a broad genre which seeks to subvert the narratives they've often times been
      framed within. But also critiques some of this work, asking if it's broad
      definition, and because of the cultural signal loss - whether it does enough
      to challenge the systems.

      The review then concludes with looking at the mythologies of Australia, how do
      we construct the "Australian Identity", how did we represent this identity in
      our earlier media, and how was this juxtaposed against Indigenous people here?

      And in recent history with films, Why have Indigenous historys and people
      been represented in this way? what is the signal loss that occurs when these
      narratives influence Indigenous people themselves?

      Meanwhile, stories from marginalized groups are more likely to
      face 'signal degradation'—where their meaning is diluted,
      reframed, or even erased. These distortions come not only from
      the limitations of media itself but also from biases in
      communication networks, which tend to favor certain voices while

      Then the literature review discusses futurisms, examining how mythologies
      about what could potentially happen in our future

      The literature review then explores what happens when those
      marginalised groups write counter-narratives that challenge
      the way they've been represented. Afrofuturism

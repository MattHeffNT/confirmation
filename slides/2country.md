<h2 style="color:black"> The Ngunnawal and Ngambri Traditional Owners of Canberra</h2>

<aside class="notes">
<ul> 

<li>I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of Canberra, or as my mum/mob call it "canna-barra-en-ya". The Ngunnawal and Ngambri people. Some of whom I've had the privilege of meeting, yarning with and working with.</li>

<li>The photo in the background is a terrible one I took off black mountain when I went hiking up there with my 2021 Master's cohort.</li> 

<li> I see that it's becoming popular again amongst Australia's media 
and certain groups to criticize acknowledgements...refuse to stand in front of one of Australia's national flags the Aboriginal flag 
and say that this is just a big waste of time and money - 
for a ceremony that was invented by Ernie Dingo in the 70, or some other form of the tale.</li>

<li>To me, it's about respect, sure, traditionally, mob wouldn't have stood in a university on the internet talking about country. But culture is always changing, it's always being negotiated...even the idea of "traditional" culture is a misnomer </li>

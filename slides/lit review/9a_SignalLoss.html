      Signal Loss is a term from information and
      communications theory and engineering.

      Signal loss can be desccribed as the degradation
      of a signal and or information when transmitted.

      examples of signal loss are heat loss, dropped packets
      and or energy loss because of the distances travelled. Usually
      this a result of the material of the conduit itself. copper,
      fence wire and so on.

      The terms has also been used in marketing data analysis
      when not enough customer data is captured during a customer journey. urgh

      Norbert Wiener also wrote about signal loss ...at least in its
      comms engineering sense. He came up with the Weiner filter
      which used probability to estimate the source signal and therefore filter
      for contaminants

      Claude Shannon, another comms/information engineer also developed
      a method for "cleaning" signals the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. This theorem is still used
      in digital systems. Simply put it is a theory to "clean" signals as they move from analog to
      digital.

      I'm interested in transplanting this idea of
      signal loss to describe the transmutation, degradation
      of signals when diffused not only through mediums.
      But also the cultural entropy that occurs when these
      stories are extracted, appropriated, owned and distributed
      through networks which are owned by a small but powerful
      demographic - one which has no interest in signal filtering.

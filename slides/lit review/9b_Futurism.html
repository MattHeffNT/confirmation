<h2>Futurism</h2>

<i> “We will glorify war—the world’s only hygiene—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers,
  beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman.” - Marinetti </i>
<br>
<br>
<i>"We will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind, will fight moralism, feminism, every opportunistic
  or utilitarian cowardice." - Marinetti </i>

      So what happens when mythologies imagine the future? This is where my readings
      led me to the interesting history of the term futurism itself. Although there
      are many types and representations of th term. it was coined by italian futurist
      and fascist filippo marinetti. this version of futurism emerged pre-wwii, and lauded the idea
      of the "future". This futurism hated Italian classical culture, the arts, intellectuals and even
      hated pasta!!! bloody pasta!!! he reckons it made Italian men sterile. Some of Marinetti's writings about the
      future were an
      idea of a future where the nutrion of food was replaced by pills, and the act of "eating" reduced
      to a luxury and aesthetic of the elite.

      Marinetti loved the idea of cars, the pace of technological development, war, and Musollini (yep they were
      Good mates and their political parties joined forces).

      An irony that I thought was worth mentioning though, is for as much as he professes his hatred for culture, myth
      He obviously can't decouple himself from the myths, ontologies and axiologies rooted in mythology
      that inform his world view.

      Prior to this coining of the term "futurism". Other texts that had "futurist" like ideas include
      the apocalyptic texts of the bible and the koran. Even the ideas of weaving narratives through the ritual
      of tarot, or rituals of fortune-telling.

      There are also the binary ideas of utopias/dystopias that existed prior to sci-fi, the garden of eden,
      paradise lost.

      These texts and myths have all informed the futurist mythologies constructed by Marinetti. </li>

      Marinetti was both a reflection and influence on his time. What vestiges of this work exist in futurist literature
      today?
      And how can telling new stories challenge the way we imagine and construct the future?

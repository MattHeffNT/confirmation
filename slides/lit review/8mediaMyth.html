<h2>Media as Mythology</h2>

<!-- lol oldschool tag -->
<i>If these out-of-date beliefs are to be called myths, then myths can be produced by the same sorts of methods and
  held for the same sorts of reasons that now lead to scientific knowledge (Kuhn, 1994, p. 3)</i>

      Beginning with Media as Mythology:

      Mythologies, Myth, stories are a fundamental part
      of what it means to be a human. The sharing of
      mythologies has occured in every single culture
      in some form like singing, ritual, books, and so on.

      Strauss had a couple of interesting observations
      in "The Structural Study of Myth"

      Strauss wrote about how myths all contain structures. and
      that by understanding these structures we could gain a deeper
      understanding about humanity. I particularly like Strauss's observation about
      the difference between the stone and steel axe, in that one isn't "better made"
      than the other. They just have a different materiality, and the cultural frameworks
      afford or constrain different mythologies.

      But to assert media is mythology...I think it's a semantic thing right?
      With the proliferation of technology that affords fast, global transmission
      of information. The term "media" has become synonomous with mass "News Media",
      which itself is starting to shift again with social media. But media is also
      the plural form of medium. Medium can be described as the material through which
      the information can be stored and or transmitted. So obviously if I'm talking about
      this I have to bring up Mcluhan. Mcluhan's famous "The medium is the message"
      alluded at the idea of media as mythology. The materiality of the medium can affect
      the myth/the information that it carries. The affordances of that medium can greatly
      affect the way in which you hear and process that information. This is all the same as mythology.

      If mythology was sung, it had patterns, rhythms, and was deeply embedded into your ritual practise
      well then you would have a hard time forgetting the song. But the meaning of the song cchanges for example
      if it is being sung at a significant person's funeral right?

      So, if the mediums through which mythologies are transmitted can impact the fidelity of the information - what
      happens when the communication medium is impacted by noise, and signal loss?
